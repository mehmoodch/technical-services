          <p><strong><em>Cookies and Other Technologies.</em></strong> When you visit websites on the Internet, your
            browser may automatically transmit information to the websites you visit throughout every visit. Like many
            websites, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to
            your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may utilize persistent cookies that only HandyPro

            Platform, to track the number of entries in HandyPro promotions, sweepstakes and contests and to identify
            visited areas of the HandyPro Platform. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your
            computer when you log off from the HandyPro Platform and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on

            objects) to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Site to personalize
            your visit. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt
            you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will

            among other things, track the actions of Users and email recipients, to determine the success of marketing
            campaigns and to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. We may also engage one or
            more third party service providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. They may use a “pixel tag”
            to collect information about your visits to the Site and to other websites, and they may use that
            information to target advertisements for goods and services. We will not share this information with third
            parties in a manner that personally identifies you except as provided herein.</p>
          <p>The following table sets out the different categories of cookies that our Services use and why we use them.

          <p>Advertising</p>
          <p>Things like cookies and pixels are used to deliver relevant ads, track ad campaign performance and

            serve you ads that may be interesting to you on other websites. Similarly, our advertisers may use a cookie,
            attribution service or another similar technology to determine whether we’ve served an ad and how it
            performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them. For more information about

              partners, sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.</li>
            <li>We may display information related to your business, including your name or your business’s name,
              publicly on your profile, except to the extent we tell you we will not display such information. If the
              information you provide us upon signing up for an account differs from the information you provide us as
              part of the verification data we collect, we have sole discretion in determining which information will be
              displayed publicly on your profile.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><em>Identity Verification.</em></strong> We may collect Personal Information, such as your date of
            birth, or taxpayer identification number, and address, to validate your identity or as may be required by
            law, such as to complete tax filings (“Identity Information”).</p>
          <p><strong><em>Financial Information.</em></strong> To help Craftsmen setup a payment account and help Clients
            make payments to Craftsmen and pay the Fees, we may collect financial information, including name, address,
            credit card number, bank routing numbers, tax information, and any other payment information (“Financial
            Information”).</p>
          <p><strong><em>Location Information.</em></strong> When you visit the HandyPro Platform via a mobile
            application, we may use GPS technology (or other similar technology) to determine your current location in
            order to determine the city you are located within and display a location map to offer a better service for
            our Users. We will not share your current location with other users. If you do not want us to use your
            location for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for the mobile
            application located in your account settings or in your mobile phone settings and/or within the mobile
            application.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Third Party Information.</em></strong> If you registered through a co-branded version of our
            HandyPro Platform through one our Partners (as defined below), they may provide us with basic information
            such as your name, address and purchase history related to your Task needs. We may receive additional
            information about you, such as demographic data, payment information, or fraud detection information, from
            third party Agents (as defined below) and combine it with other information that we have about you. Finally,
            HandyPro works with third party agents to perform identity checks and criminal background checks on
            Craftsmen, and we receive information from them such as publicly available information about their criminal
            history.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Public Areas.</em></strong> You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of
            information about you, and may include Personal Information, photographs, work history, skills, hourly pay
            rates, feedback/rating information and other information, including your username (“Profile”). The
            information in your Profile may be visible to all Users and the general public subject to the privacy
            choices you make within your Profile. If you choose to post a Task via the HandyPro Platform, the contents
            of such listing will be publicly viewable.</p>
          <p><strong>HandyPro&#x27;s Use of Personal Information</strong></p>
          <p>HandyPro uses Personal Information (including Identity Information and Financial Information) and
            non-Personal Information for the following general purposes:</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>To operate and make available the HandyPro Platform,</li>
            <li>to connect Craftsmen and Clients and facilitate transactions and payments,</li>
            <li>for billing, identification and authentication, and fraud prevention,</li>
            <li>to analyze Site usage and improve our products and the HandyPro Platform,</li>
            <li>to contact you and deliver administrative notices, marketing notifications and offers and communications
              relevant to your use of our products and the HandyPro Platform via email, SMS, push notifications, or
              otherwise,</li>
            <li>to provide you with customer support,</li>
            <li>for internal market research, troubleshooting problems, and detecting and protecting against error,
              fraud or other criminal activity,</li>
            <li>to enforce our Terms of Service, and</li>
            <li>as otherwise set forth in the Policy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><em>Advertising</em></strong> Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and
            HandyPro believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. HandyPro may use Cookies and other
            technologies and Personal Information to place ads where they believe interested parties will see them. In
            addition to banner ads, HandyPro may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest
            you through the email address you provide. Your choice regarding third party ads are set forth in the Choice
            / Opt out section below.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Analytics and Market Research.</em></strong> HandyPro may analyze Personal Information and web
            navigational data based on your interests and may use the analysis from this information in a way that
            doesn’t reveal a User’s Personal Information (“Market Research”) in order to market the HandyPro Platform,
            improve the likelihood of a sale to a group of Users, and increase the likelihood that a group&#x27;s
            experience with the HandyPro Platform is relevant to its interests as a whole.</p>
          <p>HandyPro uses data at the individual level to sell products and services to Users who express an interest
            in these products and services, through a poll for example, or to Users who can be presumed to have an
            interest based on results from our Market Research.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Cell Phone Numbers.</em></strong> HandyPro may use your cell phone number to call or text you
            in order to provide you notifications about tasks, for marketing purposes and to administer the HandyPro
            Platform. If you would like more information about our policy, or to opt out, please review below or Section
            9 of our Terms of Service, available at <a
              href="https://rashedmts.ae/terms-of-use/">https://rashedmts.ae/terms-of-use/</a>. You may be liable for
            standard SMS and per-minute charges by your mobile carrier. HandyPro may also message you via “Push”
            messaging, which you can opt-out of on your mobile device. Data rates may apply.</p>
          <p>You can opt out of receiving certain promotional communications from HandyPro sent via text message at any
            time by following the instructions provided in text messages from HandyPro to text the word,
            &quot;STOP&quot;. Please note that your opt-out is limited to the phone number used and will not affect
            subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications
            may continue. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, HandyPro may, subject to
            applicable law, continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account,
            transactions, servicing, or HandyPro’s ongoing business relations.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Financial Information.</em></strong> We use Financial Information solely as authorized by you
            in accordance with the HandyPro Platform. To keep your financial data secure, we do not store full credit
            card information on our servers. We have contracted with a third party to process your payment card
            information.</p>
          <p><strong>With Whom Does HandyPro Share Information?</strong></p>
          <p>We only share the information we collect about you as described in this Privacy Policy or as described at
            the time of collection or sharing, including as follows:</p>
          <p><strong><em>Third Party Agents.</em></strong> To operate the HandyPro Platform, including processing your
            transactions, we may share your Personal Information with Our agents, representatives, contractors and
            service providers (“Agents”) so they can provide us with support services as follows:</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>Email origination,</li>
            <li>Identity/background check requirements,</li>
            <li>Fraud detection,</li>
            <li>Receipt or support services,</li>
            <li>Customer relationship management services,</li>
            <li>Financial transaction fulfillment, and</li>
            <li>To otherwise help us provide the HandyPro Platform, including all the things described in the preceding
              section.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong><em>Third Party Partners.</em></strong> Some HandyPro content is &quot;sponsored by&quot; or
            &quot;presented by&quot; other companies. If you connect to the HandyPro Platform through a co-branded
            version of our HandyPro Platform through one of our third-party service partners (“Partners”) or otherwise
            participate in one of our partner programs with such a Partner, we may share information about your use of
            the HandyPro Platform with that Partner to offer the integrated platform and to measure how the partnership
            performs. We may share your information with our Partners in order to receive additional information about
            you. We may also share your information with Partners to create offers that may be of interest to you.
            Please check such Partner’s privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don&#x27;t
            want these Partners to have your Personal Information, you can choose to not participate.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Other Users.</em></strong> As Authorized by your use of the HandyPro Platform, HandyPro
            facilitates contact between Users and reserves the right to share a User’s contact information with another
            User or their legal or other representative in order to facilitate the resolution of a dispute related to or
            arising from an interaction between two or more Users of the platform (e.g. phone number, or email and
            postal address).</p>
          <p><strong><em>Anonymous or Aggregated Data.</em></strong> HandyPro collects, stores and shares certain data
            about the use of the HandyPro Platform on an aggregate and/or anonymous basis. HandyPro does not link this
            information to anything personally identifiable to you if shared with third parties.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Legal Obligations</em></strong> HandyPro may disclose Personal Information or User Generated
            Content, including location data or communication data, to a third party if required to do so by law or
            pursuant to a warrant or subpoena. HandyPro reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both
            private and public areas of the Site in the absence of a warrant or subpoena if we are given reason to
            believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interference with the rights of Users,
            the general public, or HandyPro, to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.</p>
          <p>It is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law
            enforcement requests unless (i) we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have reason
            to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or
            notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an emergency
            request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact). Law
            enforcement officials who do not want their requests disclosed should provide an appropriate court order or
            process establishing that notice is prohibited, or provide sufficient detail for HandyPro to determine
            whether a request falls into one of the exceptions above.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Business Affiliates.</em></strong> Finally, HandyPro reserves the right to transfer, sell
            and/or distribute all information collected through the HandyPro Platform to an affiliate, subsidiary, or
            third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other
            disposition of all or part of our business, assets or stock. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the
            new entity follows this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information, as and to the extent
            required by applicable law.</p>
          <p><strong>Third Party Sites</strong></p>
          <p>As part of the functionality of the Site and the HandyPro Platform, you may link your HandyPro account with
            online accounts you may have with third party sites, such as Facebook. If you connect your account with one
            of these services, you may be giving such third-party services access to your Personal Information or
            Contact Data.</p>
          <p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong></p>
          <p>You may opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners, remove your information from our
            database, and choose to not receive future communications unrelated to the HandyPro Platform by cancelling
            your account; if you wish to do so, please contact us at <a target="_blank"
              href="https://rashedmts.ae/contact-us/">https://rashedmts.ae/contact-us/</a>.</p>
          <p>During registration, you choose whether to receive marketing correspondence from either HandyPro or its
            partners and whether you want to participate in a variety of HandyPro programs. This information remains on
            your Profile where you can, at any point, easily edit it to indicate that you have changed your mind. After
            logging on, click on your profile on the top right of any page, then select “Notifications.” You may then
            click on &quot;email alerts,&quot; and make your selections. If you purchase anything through HandyPro, we
            may occasionally contact you with information about special events, sales, activities, promotions, contests,
            submission opportunities and programs. You always have the option to ask HandyPro not to contact you with
            this information again.</p>
          <p>If you receive unsolicited email from a HandyPro domain, please contact us at <a target="_blank"

          <p><strong>HandyPro&#x27;s Information Retention Policy</strong></p>
          <p>To preserve the integrity of our databases, we may retain information submitted by Users for an indefinite
            length of time as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our
            agreements. If required by law, we will delete Personal Information by erasing it from our database. We will
            also respond to User requests to delete or correct account or Personal Information, which you can do by
            contacting HandyPro at <a target="_blank"
              href="https://rashedmts.ae/contact-us/">https://rashedmts.ae/contact-us/</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>User Generated Content</strong></p>
          <p>For each User seeking to provide task services via the HandyPro Platform (each, a “Tasker”) who has
            provided HandyPro with any videotape, film, record, photograph, voice, or all related instrumental, musical,
            or other sound effects, you consent to our use of these materials as User Generated Content in accordance
            with Section 14 of the Terms of Service, available at <a
              href="https://rashedmts.ae/terms-of-use/">https://rashedmts.ae/terms-of-use/</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>HandyPro’s Security of Collected Information</strong></p>
          <p>Your HandyPro account is password-protected so that only you and authorized HandyPro staff have access to
            your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. Also,
            if you share a computer, you should sign out of your HandyPro account and close the browser window before
            someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to
            third parties.</p>
          <p>HandyPro takes reasonable precautions to ensure that your information is secure on its system by backing up
            data in separate backup drives and uses public key access encryption and firewalls on both our main and
            backup servers. HandyPro has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy
            initiatives, periodically reviewing security and making sure that every HandyPro employee is aware of our
            security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
            secure. As a result, HandyPro cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you
            do so at your own risk. While HandyPro will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of
            all credit card and all other Personal Information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any unauthorized
            access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all Personal Information and/or Financial Information
            stored therein, and you agree to hold HandyPro harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. If you
            have any further questions on this issue, please refer to the Terms of Service, available at <a
              href="https://rashedmts.ae/terms-of-use/">https://rashedmts.ae/terms-of-use/</a>.</p>
          <p>HandyPro expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the
            information you submit to the HandyPro Platform.</p>
          <p><strong>How Can Users Access and Edit Their Information?</strong></p>
          <p>HandyPro believes strongly in giving you the ability to access and edit your Personal Information. To
            update your Personal Information, click Login at the top of any page. There you can view, update and correct
            your account information. You may edit your account information at any time -- all you need is your username
            and password.</p>
          <p>So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as
            your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under 18 are not allowed to register
            as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users&#x27; ages. You have a
            right to access your personal information. Please contact us at privacy@rashedmts.ae to find out how to
            access and change information you cannot access through your account.</p>
          <p>Our databases automatically update any Personal Information you edit in your profile, or that you request
            we edit. Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or through any other means remains in our
            databases and becomes the property of HandyPro upon submission.</p>
          <p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
          <p>HandyPro&#x27;s security and Privacy Policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. This
            policy might change as HandyPro updates and expands the HandyPro Platform. HandyPro will endeavor to notify
            you of any material changes by email, but will not be liable for any failure to do so. HandyPro also
            encourages you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. If you do not understand any of the terms or
            conditions of any of HandyPro&#x27;s policies, you may inquire regarding the same via email at <a
              target="_blank" href="https://rashedmts.ae/contact-us/">https://rashedmts.ae/contact-us/</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Children’s Privacy and Note to Parents and Guardians</strong></p>
          <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. The HandyPro Platform
            is not directed to children under the age of 13 and children under 13 are not permitted to use the HandyPro
            Platform. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information from a child under the
            age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database. If you
            are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13, and you believe that your child has provided us
            with personal information, please contact us using the information in the “Contacting Us” section at the end
            of the Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
          <p>California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how
            certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those
            third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either
            provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt in to,
            or opt out of, this type of sharing.</p>
          <p>HandyPro may share personal information with third parties or affiliates for such third parties’ or
            affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. California residents may obtain information about our compliance
            with this law by sending us an email or letter to the address specified in the “Contacting Us” section
            below. Requests must include “California Privacy Rights Request” in the first line of the description and
            include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that HandyPro is not required to
            respond to requests made by means other than through the provided email address or mail address.</p>
